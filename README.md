# Turkish-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on Turkish text data using the Naive Bayes classifier. The code reads text files from a specified directory, preprocesses the data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and links, and applies stemming and tokenization techniques. 

The TF-IDF vectorization method is then used to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is trained on the features and used for sentiment classification. The code also includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as a confusion matrix. Additionally, cross-validation and feature analysis are performed to further assess the model's performance.
